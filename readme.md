# KNN-Based Health Risk Predictor

A web-based Health Risk Prediction System built using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm and deployed with **Flask**. This project predicts potential health risks based on user-entered medical metrics such as age, BMI, blood pressure, glucose level, and cholesterol.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/knn-health-predictor.git
cd knn-health-predictor
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Train the Model

```bash
python model/train_model.py
```

This will generate the model and scaler file needed for predictions.
